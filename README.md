ARA(Assistance Robot Arm) is an assistive feeding device that helps older adults and individuals with upper-limb amputation eat comfortably and safely on their own—without relying on others.
It prioritizes a comfortable design, intuitive operation, and affordability, reducing the workload on care and nursing staff while promoting users’ autonomy and self-esteem.
